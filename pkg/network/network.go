// ResetNetworkConfig is a common reset procedure that works for all NetworkManager based installations.
//
// It is important that once the elemental-system-agent marks the reset-trigger plan as completed,
// the assigned IPs are no longer used.
// This to prevent any race condition in which the remote MachineInventory is deleted,
// the associated IPAddressClaims are also deleted, but the machine is still using the IPAddresses from those claims.
//
// Also note that this method is called twice, since the first time we restart the elemental-system-agent.
// The reason for that restart is that after restarting the NetworkManager, the elemental-system-agent process hangs
// waiting for the (old) connection timeout. This can lead to the scheduled shutdown to trigger (and reset from recovery start),
// before the elemental-system-agent has time to recover from the connection change and confirm the application of the reset-trigger plan.
// Potentially this can lead to an infinite reset loop.
